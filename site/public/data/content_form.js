        description: "<p>I come from Taiwan. I enjoy friendship and adventure, even thought being an introvert, I sometimes am intimidated by meeting new groups of people. Sharing interests  and good laugh with friends and family brings joy to my life. I love movies, literature, cuisine, wine and badminton. I am always searching for beauty and quality life. People are story-tellers and yarn for meaning in life. Relationship and love lights up every day life and motivate people to pursue. As a counseling psychologist, I am honored to share your life journey, and explore with your story, sorrow or joy. While it can feel hopeless from time to time, I will accompany you going through it and see the lights.</p><p>我是黃盈霓，來自台灣，是註冊於紐西蘭心理師公會的諮商心理師。我喜愛電影、打羽毛球、和探索美好的事物，受到紐西蘭美麗土地的吸引，也想體驗不同文化，因此做了個冒險的決定，從台灣的舒適圈中走出來，希望能延續我在台灣的諮商心理師專業，開創美麗新生活，和人們一起成長。</p>MY QUALIFICATIONS:<dl>Training<dt>Level 2, EMOTIONALLY FOCUSED THERAPY, NZCEFT</dt><dt>COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGIST WITH APC, NEW ZEALAND PSYCHOLOGIST BOARD</dt><dt>PROVISIONAL MEMBER NZAC</dt><dt>TAIWAN LICENSED COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGIST</dt></dl><dl>Degree<dt>M.A. MULTICULTURAL COUNSELING, UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST, U.S.A.</dt><dt>M.S.
